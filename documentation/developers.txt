BuildingsStackPtr:
	- Index (1 byte): 
	- Team (1 byte): 0 = team 1, 1 = team 2
	- Health (1 byte): current health of the building
	- Hitpoints (1 byte): amount of hitpoints of castle, tower etc
	- X (1 byte): X position of the building on the map
	- Y (1 byte): Y position of the building on the map

UnitsStackPtr:
	- Index (1 byte): 
	- Team (1 byte): 0 = team 1, 1 = team 2
	- Event (1 byte): current event the unit is doing
	- Health (1 byte): health of the unit
	- Hitpoints (1 byte): amount of hitpoints of this unit
	- Path (3 bytes): pointer to the path data
	- Next (1 byte): unit id of the next unit in the chain
	- OffsetX (1 byte): X offset on the tile itself
	- OffsetY (1 byte): Y offset on the tile itself
	- Prev (1 byte): unit id of the previous unit in the chain
	- X (1 byte): X position of the unit on the map
	- Y (1 byte): Y position of the unit on the map

SchedulingEventsPtr:
	- Pointer (3 bytes): pointer to the handler
	- Unit (1 byte): unit id
	- Time (4 bytes): timestamp at which the event should run

BuildingsSpritesPtr: BuildingsLoaded
	- TeamLoaded (1 byte): 0 = team 1, 1 = team 2
	- RAMPtr (3 bytes): pointer to the sprite data in RAM
	- TCPPtr (3 bytes): pointer to the TCP data of the building
	- Type (1 byte): building type

UnitsSpritesPtr: UnitsLoaded, UnitsActive
	- TeamLoaded (1 byte): 0 = team 1, 1 = team 2
	- TCPPtr (3 bytes): pointer to the unit data in RAM
	- RAMPtr (3 bytes): pointer to the TCP data of the unit
	- Type (1 byte): unit type



RAM data:
	- AoCE
		- BuildingsLoaded: a stack with information about which buildings are loaded in RAM
		- UnitsLoaded: a stack with information which units are loaded in RAM
		- UnitsActive: a stack with booleans whether units are needed or not
	- Map data
	- Sprites: gameplay, tiles, trees
	- BuildingsStackPtr: a stack with all buildings in the game, with information such as team, location etc
	- UnitsStackPtr: a stack with all the units in the game, including information such as event, type, path etc
	- SchedulingEventsPtr: a stack with all the upcoming events
	- BuildingsSpritesPtr: a pointer to the end of the buildings sprites data
end of RAM:
	- UnitsSpritesPtr: a pointer to the begin of the units sprites data
	- Stack

BuildingsSpritesPtr and UnitsSpritesPtr grow towards each other, and AoCE should error if they overlap (i.e. not enough memory available)
