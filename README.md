This is a TI-84 Plus CE clone of the popular game Age of Empires 2, written in Assembly.

## Build
To build AoCE, download and install the latest [C toolchain](https://github.com/ce-programming/toolchain/releases/latest). From the root project directory, run `make gfx` to build the graphics, and then `make` to build AoCE.

### Troubleshooting
Here are some errors you might encounter during building, and respectively their solutions.
* *`make` is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file* = update/download the C toolchain.
* *`fasmg` is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file* = update/download the C toolchain.
* *`convpng` is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file* = update/download the C toolchain.
* *`convhex` is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file* = update/download the C toolchain.
* Anything else = redownload and rebuild this repo, or [ask me](http://chat.efnet.org:9090/?nick=AoCEuser&channels=%23aoce-dev&Login=Login) on the EFnet IRC channel #aoce-dev (or #cemetech).

## Run
To run AoCE, copy `AOCE.8xp`, `AOCEAGE1.8xv`, `AOCEAGE2.8xv`, `AOCEAGE3.8xv`, `AOCEAGE4.8xv`, `AOCEGFX1.8xv`, `AOCEGFX2.8xv`, `AOCEUNI1.8xv` and `AOCEUNI2.8xv` to either CEmu or drag them into TI-Connect CE. In both cases, be sure to put them all in archive! The appvars are quite large, so they don't all fit in RAM. From the homescreen, run `Asm(prgmAOCE)` to run AoCE.

### Bugs
If you found a bug in the latest AoCE from the master branch, be sure to create an issue [here](https://github.com/PeterTillema/Age-Of-CEmpires-I/issues). Note that other branches might not be stable!
